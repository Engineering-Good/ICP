Independent Creative Photography (T4G 2022)

# Description
Persons with MD typically are unable to take photographs or videos on their own, be it on smartphones or cameras. Depending on the severity of their condition, they may be unable to hold their device to position the shot (including selfies), click on the button to snap the photo and review their shot immediately on their device or camera. Those with a severe condition can only rely on their caregivers to help them take photographs. A solution that is hands-free, portable, and easy to use will enable persons with MD to exercise independence and full creative control over their work. There is varied interest in photography, from mobile phones for the casual photophile, action cameras for the adventurists, to DSLRs for the pros.

# Expected Outcome
A simple way for persons with MD to take photographs independently. The solution should be able to mount on a motorized wheelchair without obstructing the movement of the user.
